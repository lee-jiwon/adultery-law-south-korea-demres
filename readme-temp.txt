The KLoWF dataset can also be otained direcly from the KLoWF Portal (https://gsis.kwdi.re.kr/klowf/portal/eng/dataSet/), which now includes an English version with english variable labels (as of November 27, 2024).

(Important Note: The latest version of KLoWF, as of November 27, 2024, includes significant updates to variable names (and possibly minor changes to the variables themselves), which will require manual adjustments to the code for alignment. 
The changes to the variables, if any, may affect the ability to fully replicate the findings. To ensure exact replication, it is recommended to use the specific version of the dataset utilized in the study, available via the Dropbox link above)
